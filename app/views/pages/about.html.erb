        <h5>History</h5>
        <p>I graduated high school in 2008 and soon after joined the Royal Australian Air Force.  I completed my full-time service period and continued on a part-time basis in the RAAF Reserves.  I also applied to become a corrections officer and continued to work inside a prison for the next 6 years.  I've now decided to finally pursue my dream and study software development with the help of Coder Academy, and I'm glad I did!</p>
